# 🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project predicts **medical insurance costs** based on a person's demographic and health-related attributes using **Linear Regression**.  

It was built as part of my learning journey in **Machine Learning & AI**, using **Python** in **Google Colab**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Insurance companies often need to estimate medical costs for their customers.  
By analyzing past insurance data, we can train a model to **predict the charges** for new customers, which helps in risk assessment and premium calculation.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/medical-insurance-cost-prediction)  
- **Features:**
  - `age` - Age of the individual  
  - `sex` - Gender of the individual  
  - `bmi` - Body Mass Index  
  - `children` - Number of children/dependents  
  - `smoker` - Smoking status  
  - `region` - Residential area in the US  
  - `charges` - Insurance charges (target variable)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualizations)  
- Scikit-Learn (Linear Regression model)  
- Google Colab (development environment)  

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling categorical features (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`)
   - Encoding categorical data into numerical format  
   - Splitting into training & testing sets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions of age, BMI, charges   

3. **Model Training**
   - Applied **Linear Regression**  
   - Evaluated with **R² Score**  

## 📈 Results
- Achieved a reasonably good prediction accuracy using Linear Regression
